Create a realistic phone conversation script with:
- Natural dialogue with pauses and interruptions
- The caller should continue naturally even if the user stays silent
- Keep it believable and not overly dramatic
- Duration should be around ${scenario.duration || 30} seconds

IMPORTANT: Only provide the actual spoken dialogue. Do NOT include:
- Background sound descriptions (like "pause", "typing sounds", etc.)
- Stage directions or actions in parentheses
- Sound effects or ambient noise descriptions

Format the response as a series of dialogue lines that the AI caller will speak.`;
